# Chess
## Pre-project thoughts

This is my biggest project so far in this course. This is on par with a pdf editing program I did a year ago. I should start with trying to implement the moves of each and then expand from that.

## Road map

1. Implement basic moves for all.
2. Implement check, check mate.
3. Implement castling, enpassant.

## Mid-project thoughts

There are a lot of rules in chess. It is hard to keep everything organized in my head. I need to have very clearly defined classes. I will make a new module with all the rule checks. It will check for:

 - When making move, if a move is legal. 
	also  - Legal moves when king is in check
 - If enpassant is possible
 - if Castling is possible.
 - If king is in check
 - If king is in check mate
