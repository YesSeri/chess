# Chess
## Pre-project thoughts

This is my biggest project so far in this course. This is on par with a pdf editing program I did a year ago. I should start with trying to implement the moves of each and then expand from that.

## Road map

1. Implement basic moves for all.
2. Implement check, check mate.
3. Implement castling, enpassant.
